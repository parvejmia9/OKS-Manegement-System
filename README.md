Database Design Process
This database project is developed by ORACLE. I developed six new tables and inserted data from file. 
I learned several important lessons through the design process. These include:

1)	Designing tables is the most important step and must be done early in the project.

2) Building a database from scratch is often easier than revising an existing databaseâ€“ which is why initial design is so important and was stressed throughout the course!


Discussion & Conclusion
The project was a learning experience for us and allowed us to improve upon our SQL skills. From this we learn about database management system, SQL query, function procedure, trigger, cursor etc. that help us for future database development. We developed a database system for managing the information of Organization of KUET Sports.
